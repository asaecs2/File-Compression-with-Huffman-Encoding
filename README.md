# File-Compression-with-Huffman-Encoding

 1) Implemented Huffman Encoding: Developed a Huffman encoding project that applies the widely-used Huffman algorithm for lossless data compression. Utilized efficient data structures such as priority queues and binary trees to construct the Huffman tree and generate optimal codes. Technologies used include C++ Standard Library for data structures and algorithms.

 2) Supported Directory Compression: Extended the project's functionality to include the compression and decompression of directories, allowing for the efficient processing of multiple files within a directory structure. Implemented a recursive approach using <filesystem> library for directory traversal. Utilized data structures and techniques from Huffman Encoding to compress and decompress each file individually.

 3) Handled Different File Types: Enhanced the project's versatility by incorporating support for handling various file types, including text files and image files. Adapted the encoding scheme accordingly to accommodate different file formats. Leveraged technologies such as C++ Standard Library for file I/O operations and <algorithm> library for file type identification and specific encoding techniques.
